            <p>
                Hi, I am Dave Rowan V. Paunil, a first year undergrad taking Computer Science at Batangas 
                State University.  The onset of new technology has brought us innovative ways of dealing with 
                problems and one way is through programming, hence ,I have become interested to be a part of this field.
           </p>
             <p>
                In the long term, I aim to be a skilled software engineer who can develop effective 
                programs that can make life simpler and enjoyable. I enjoy  the process of problem-solving and providing creative solutions especially with the help of current technology.
            </p>

                                was conceptualized by mainly focusing  on the usage of loops, arrays, and conditional statements.</p>

                Access to quality education is valuable to everyone hence, it is a right. 
                Through scholarships that provide financial assistance, donation of school supplies,and free education,
                were  the means of achieving this sustainable development goal. But when the internet  was introduced, a shift
                to providing quality content online has been added as one of the impactful solutions. The distribution of globally accessible 
                learning resources, communities have paved its way to a new way of learning.
